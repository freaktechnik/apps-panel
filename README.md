# DEPRECATED
Due to [the removal of WebRunner](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1238079),
the thing that runs web apps as "native" apps, on Firefox desktop and the
eventual deprecation of packaged apps as a whole, the development of this
extension has been stopped.

# Web App Panel
Access all installed web apps from within Firefox and open them as tab in Firefox. This acts as a kind of launcher within Firefox for web apps instead of going through your system's application launcher.
